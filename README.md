For the final project, we were working as an AI developer for a gaming company. We were tasked with creating an intelligent agent that navigated the game world,
which involved going through different pathways and obstacles to find the treasure. We were given most of the code for the project, but we were responsible for
completing the Q-training algorithm.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are responsible for developing algorithms, systems, software, AI, etc., that solve real-world problems.
    
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by figuring out what the "result" is supposed to be. Say for example, I were making a sandwich. I would first figure out
what I wanted or what was supposed to be on said sandwich. Once I know what the sandwich is supposed to look like and how it's supposed to taste, I can then figure out
how to go about designing that sandwich. The same logic can be applied to solving a problem as a computer scientist. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are vital. For the end user, I am responsible for upholding their data privacy,
creating safe and secure software, keeping accessbility in mind for all users, and taking responsibility for my work and the consequences of that work.

For the organization, I must write honest and maintainable code that is up to organizational standards and design code with integrity and safety of the users in mind.
